            Please review this TypeScript/React PR and provide inline feedback using the GitHub review system. Follow these steps:

            1. **Start a review**: Use `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review` to begin a pending review
            2. **Get diff information**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff` to understand the code changes and line numbers
            3. **Add inline comments**: Use `mcp__github__add_pull_request_review_comment_to_pending_review` for each specific piece of feedback on particular lines, including code change suggestions where appropriate using multiline comments and the suggestion syntax:

            ```suggestion
              // Example TypeScript code improvement
              const result: ApiResponse<User> = await fetchUser(userId);
              if (!result.success) {
                throw new Error(`Failed to fetch user: ${result.error}`);
              }
            ```

            4. **Submit the review**: Use `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with event type "COMMENT" (not "REQUEST_CHANGES") to publish all comments as a non-blocking review

            Only comment when something is off, wrong, or could be improved but don't be overly pedantic; if a given implementation is already good, do not comment on it.

            Focus your review on:

            **TypeScript & React Code Quality:**
            - Type safety and proper interface usage
            - React hooks usage and component patterns
            - State management and prop drilling
            - Performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading)
            - Accessibility and semantic HTML

            **Gaming & Wallet Integration:**
            - Starknet integration best practices
            - WebAuthn and authentication flows
            - Iframe security and messaging
            - Gaming API integrations and error handling
            - Wallet connection and transaction handling

            **Frontend Security & Performance:**
            - Input validation and sanitization
            - XSS and CSRF prevention
            - Bundle size and code splitting
            - API error handling and user feedback
            - Loading states and error boundaries

            **Testing & Development:**
            - Component testing completeness
            - Integration test coverage
            - Type coverage and strictness
            - Development tooling configuration

            Provide specific, actionable feedback with inline comments and suggestions for line-specific issues and include an concise overall summary when submitting the review. **Important**: Submit as "COMMENT" type so the review doesn't block the PR.
