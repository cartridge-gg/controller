            Please review this frontend PR and provide inline feedback using the GitHub review system. Follow these steps:

            1. **Start a review**: Use `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review` to begin a pending review
            2. **Get diff information**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff` to understand the code changes and line numbers
            3. **Add inline comments**: Use `mcp__github__add_pull_request_review_comment_to_pending_review` for each specific piece of feedback on particular lines, including code change suggestions where appropriate using multiline comments and the suggestion syntax:

            ```suggestion
              // Example TypeScript improvement
              const result: ApiResponse<User> = await fetchUser(userId);
              if (result.error) {
                throw new Error(result.error.message);
              }
            ```

            4. **Submit the review**: Use `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with event type "COMMENT" (not "REQUEST_CHANGES") to publish all comments as a non-blocking review

            Only comment when something is off, wrong, or could be improved but don't be overly pedantic; if a given implementation is already good, do not comment on it.

            Focus your review on:

            **TypeScript & React:**
            - Type safety and proper interface usage
            - React component best practices and patterns
            - Hook usage and lifecycle management
            - State management and side effects
            - Component composition and reusability

            **Web3 & Gaming Integration:**
            - Starknet wallet integration security
            - WebAuthn implementation best practices
            - Session management and authentication flows
            - Gaming API integrations and error handling
            - Iframe security and cross-origin considerations

            **Performance & UX:**
            - Bundle size and code splitting optimization
            - React rendering optimization (useMemo, useCallback)
            - Loading states and error boundaries
            - Accessibility considerations
            - Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions

            **Testing & Quality:**
            - Component testing coverage and quality
            - Integration test completeness
            - Mock usage and test isolation
            - Edge case handling

            **Security:**
            - Input validation and sanitization
            - Secure storage of sensitive data
            - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
            - Content Security Policy adherence

            Provide specific, actionable feedback with inline comments and suggestions for line-specific issues and include an concise overall summary when submitting the review. **Important**: Submit as "COMMENT" type so the review doesn't block the PR.
