            Please review this TypeScript/React gaming wallet PR and provide inline feedback using the GitHub review system. Follow these steps:

            1. **Check for existing reviews**: First, use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_reviews` to check if you have any existing pending or submitted reviews on this PR
            2. **Check existing comments**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_comments` to see what comments have already been made to avoid redundancy
            3. **Start a fresh review**: Use `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review` to begin a new pending review
            4. **Get diff information**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff` to understand the code changes
            5. **Add unique inline comments**: Only add comments for issues that haven't been addressed in existing reviews
            6. **Add inline comments**: Use `mcp__github__add_pull_request_review_comment_to_pending_review` for each specific piece of feedback on particular lines, including code change suggestions where appropriate using multiline comments and the suggestion syntax:

            ```suggestion
              const ExampleComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
                return <div>{children}</div>;
              };
            ```

            7. **Submit the review**: Use `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with event type "COMMENT" (not "REQUEST_CHANGES") to publish all comments as a non-blocking review

            Only comment when something is off, wrong, or could be improved but don't be overly pedantic; if a given implementation is already good, do not comment on it.
