            Please review this TypeScript/React PR and provide inline feedback using the GitHub review system. Follow these steps:

            1. **Check for existing reviews**: First, use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_reviews` to check if you have any existing pending or submitted reviews on this PR
            2. **Check existing comments**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_comments` to see what comments have already been made to avoid redundancy
            3. **Start a fresh review**: Use `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review` to begin a new pending review
            4. **Get diff information**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff` to understand the code changes
            5. **Add unique inline comments**: Only add comments for issues that haven't been addressed in existing reviews
            6. **Add inline comments**: Use `mcp__github__add_pull_request_review_comment_to_pending_review` for each specific piece of feedback on particular lines, including code change suggestions where appropriate using multiline comments and the suggestion syntax:

            ```suggestion
            const handleSubmit = useCallback(async (data: FormData) => {
              // Implementation here
            }, []);
            ```

            7. **Submit the review**: Use `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with event type "COMMENT" (not "REQUEST_CHANGES") to publish all comments as a non-blocking review

            Only comment when something is off, wrong, or could be improved but don't be overly pedantic; if a given implementation is already good, do not comment on it.

            Focus your review on:

            **TypeScript & Code Quality:**
            - Type safety and proper interface/type definitions
            - Proper use of TypeScript features (generics, union types, etc.)
            - Code organization and module structure
            - Import/export patterns and dependency management

            **React & Frontend Best Practices:**
            - Component design and reusability
            - Hook usage patterns and custom hooks
            - State management and data flow
            - Performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading)
            - Proper cleanup and memory leak prevention

            **Gaming & Web3 Integration:**
            - Starknet integration best practices
            - WebAuthn implementation security
            - iframe security considerations
            - Gaming API integrations and error handling

            **Security & Performance:**
            - Input validation and sanitization
            - XSS prevention and secure coding practices
            - Bundle size and loading performance
            - Accessibility (a11y) compliance
            - Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions

            **Testing & Quality:**
            - Test coverage and quality
            - Component testing strategies
            - Integration test completeness
            - Mock and fixture appropriateness

            Provide specific, actionable feedback with inline comments and suggestions for line-specific issues. Include an concise overall summary when submitting the review.

            **Important**: Submit as "COMMENT" type so the review doesn't block the PR.
