For deep links, the session data arrives\n    *after* construction via `ingestSessionFromRedirect()`, so `_init()`\n    never sees it. Result: `probe()` had no path to create the account.\n    \n    **Solution:** Restore on-demand session retrieval in public methods\n    (`probe()`, `connect()`, `username()`), matching the pre-#2401 behavior.\n    Both web redirects (query param flow) and deep links (explicit call\n    flow) now work correctly.\n    \n    ## Changes\n    \n    - Split initialization: `_setSigningKeys()` (sync) handles signer setup,\n    `_resolvePreset()` (async) handles preset resolution\n    - Restore on-demand account retrieval: `tryRetrieveSessionAccount()`\n    called by public methods when account not set\n    - Rename `tryRetrieveFromQueryOrStorage` → `tryRetrieveSessionAccount`\n    for clarity and mark as private\n    - Add comments explaining the two session entry points (localStorage and\n    URL query params)\n    - Improve variable naming: `_ready` → `_readyPromise`\n    \n    Co-authored-by: Claude Haiku 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n packages/controller/src/session/provider.ts | 96 ++++++++++++++++-------------\n 1 file changed, 54 insertions(+), 42 deletions(-)\n\ncommit 6e6b4b4e455275701864d25602bb462bc2f82d5c\nAuthor: Tarrence van As <tarrencev@users.noreply.github.com>\nDate:   Fri Feb 13 14:42:14 2026 -0600\n\n    Revert mainnet USDC token support change (#2410)\n    \n    ## Summary\n    - Revert the USDC mainnet support update that was already merged in\n    commit 94dae94e.\n    - Restore legacy behavior for token metadata and mainnet token indexing\n    entries.\n    - No functional changes beyond the rollback are included.\n    \n    ## Commit(s)\n    - 41e7b707 Revert \"feat: add new mainnet USDC and label legacy as\n    USDC.e\"\n\n packages/keychain/src/utils/token-metadata.ts    | 6 ------\n packages/torii-config/public-tokens/mainnet.toml | 4 +---\n 2 files changed, 1 insertion(+), 9 deletions(-)\n\ncommit 74ddfe2c6d132bf73e3f77d4f859729cfb2b24fd\nAuthor: Daniel Kronovet <kronovet@gmail.com>\nDate:   Fri Feb 13 15:37:30 2026 -0500\n\n    Extract startapp query parameter into constant (#2412)\n    \n    Extract the hardcoded \"startapp\" string literal into\n    `REDIRECT_QUERY_NAME` constant across the session provider and node\n    server.\n    \n    This improves maintainability and documents that the parameter name\n    follows Telegram mini app convention, though the choice is arbitrary.\n    \n    Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n packages/controller/src/constants.ts         |  4 ++++\n packages/controller/src/node/server.ts       |  3 ++-\n packages/controller/src/session/provider.ts  |  8 ++++----\n packages/keychain/src/utils/api/generated.ts | 17 +++++++++++++++++\n 4 files changed, 27 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)\n\ncommit 94dae94e3160a73848da7a16fa21a45a65634c7d\nAuthor: Tarrence van As <tarrence@vanas.family>\nDate:   Fri Feb 13 15:23:31 2026 -0500\n\n    feat: add new mainnet USDC and label legacy as USDC.e\n\n packages/keychain/src/utils/token-metadata.ts    | 6 ++++++\n packages/torii-config/public-tokens/mainnet.toml | 4 +++-\n 2 files changed, 9 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\ncommit 3e88452c61ec37b4c01c4caaf84ab3efc34b50c7\nAuthor: Yun <broody@gmail.com>\nDate:   Fri Feb 13 09:26:48 2026 -1000\n\n    Fix preset theme + custom policy override precedence (#2408)\n    \n    This fixes policy precedence so apps can keep preset-derived\n    config/theme while explicitly overriding preset policies.\\n\\nWhen\n    shouldOverridePresetPolicies is true, keychain now uses provided URL\n    policies even if a preset is present.\\nWhen a preset has no chain\n    policies, keychain now falls back to provided URL policies.\\nAdded\n    targeted tests for override, fallback, and loading behavior in\n    connection policy resolution.\\n\\nNote: local pre-commit failed on an\n    environment issue in connector test:ci (vitest not found), so this\n    commit was created with --no-verify after running focused keychain\n    tests.\n\n packages/controller/src/iframe/keychain.ts     | 13 +++-\n packages/keychain/src/hooks/connection.test.ts | 67 +++++++++++++++++-\n packages/keychain/src/hooks/connection.ts      | 96 ++++++++++++++++++--------\n 3 files changed, 144 insertions(+), 32 deletions(-)","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5206a776-bf63-4db8-b6bc-99329d069763","uuid":"75c6162b-dd80-49e0-b9ec-03fe9d07cbc7"}
