The user wants me to analyze the changes and update documentation in the docs repository accordingly.\n\nb. **Request Type**: This is an implementation request - I need to analyze the PR changes and update documentation files in the docs-repo directory.\n\nc. **Key Information**:\n   - PR was an automated release preparation (version bump to 0.13.4)\n   - Changed 11 files, mostly package.json files updating versions\n   - Also updated CHANGELOG.md and output.txt\n   - This appears to be a standard version bump across the monorepo\n   - The docs repository is checked out in the `docs-repo` directory\n\nd. **Main Tasks and Challenges**:\n   - Analyze the specific changes in the PR to understand what was modified\n   - Review existing documentation in docs-repo to understand structure\n   - Determine if version bump requires documentation updates\n   - Most likely this is just a version bump, so documentation changes may be minimal\n\ne. **High-level Plan**:\n   1. Read the changed files to understand the nature of changes\n   2. Check the docs-repo directory structure and existing documentation\n   3. Determine if any documentation updates are needed for version 0.13.4\n   4.

Opens a browser to the Cartridge keychain for one-time user authentication\n   178→2. Generates an ephemeral session keypair locally\n   179→3. **Registers the session key on-chain** with the approved policies compiled into a merkle root\n   180→4. Stores the session private key locally (in `localStorage` or on the filesystem)\n   181→\n   182→After registration, transactions are signed with the session key and executed via `executeFromOutside()` — no further UI is needed.\n   183→Because the session key is not the owner key, **policies are enforced on-chain** — every transaction must include a merkle proof showing the call matches the registered policies.\n   184→The owner key is never exposed through this provider, so there is no fallback for calls outside the approved policies.\n   185→\n   186→### When to use which\n   187→\n   188→| | ControllerProvider | SessionProvider |\n   189→|---|---|---|\n   190→| **Environment** | Web browsers | Native apps, Node.js, or environments without iframe support |\n   191→| **Signing** | Session key in iframe (owner key fallback) | Ephemeral session key stored locally |\n   192→| **Policy enforcement** | Keychain (wallet-level) | On-chain (merkle proofs) |\n   193→| **Non-policy calls** | Prompts user, signs with owner key | Not supported |\n   194→| **Auth UX** | Embedded keychain modal | Browser redirect + deep link back |\n   195→| **After auth** | Iframe signs each transaction | Transactions execute without UI |\n   196→\n   197→### ControllerConnector (Web)\n   198→\n   199→`ControllerConnector` wraps `ControllerProvider` for use with frontend

the `StarknetWindowObject` interface.\n   288→However, the ControllerConnector also supports the [get-starknet wallet standard](https://get-starknet.vercel.app/), enabling integration with libraries like `starknet-react` and `solid.js`.\n   289→\n   290→You can use the ControllerConnector to cast `Controller` to the wallet-standard compatible `WalletWithStarknetFeatures` interface:\n   291→\n   292→```tsx\n   293→import { ControllerConnector } from \"@cartridge/connector\";\n   294→import type { WalletWithStarknetFeatures } from \"@starknet-io/get-starknet-wallet-standard/features\";\n   295→\n   296→// Now compatible with any library that expects WalletWithStarknetFeatures\n   297→const controller: WalletWithStarknetFeatures = (new ControllerConnector()).asWalletStandard();\n   298→```\n   299→\n   300→:::warning\n   301→The `asWalletStandard()` method is an experimental feature and may contain bugs.\n   302→Please [report any issues](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/controller/issues) you encounter.\n   303→:::\n   304→\n   305→### SessionConnector (Native)\n   306→\n   307→`SessionConnector` wraps `SessionProvider` for use in native and mobile applications.\n   308→It requires explicit `rpc` and `chainId` parameters because it operates outside a framework like `starknet-react` that would normally provide these.\n   309→The `redirectUrl` is where the browser will redirect after authentication completes.\n   310→\n   311→:::tip\n   312→To learn more about native application workflows, read our [native integration guide](/controller/native/overview).\n   313→:::\n   314→\n   315→```tsx\n   316→import { constants } from \"starknet\";\n   317→\n   318→import { SessionPolicies } from \"@cartridge/controller\";\n   319→import { SessionConnector } from \"@cartridge/connector\";\n   320→\n   321→const policies: SessionPolicies = {\n   322→  // Define session policies here\n   323→ };\n   324→\n   325→const sessionConnector = new SessionConnector({\n   326→  policies,\n   327→  rpc: \"https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet\",  // Required: no framework provider\n   328→  chainId: constants.StarknetChainId.SN_MAIN,          // Required: no framework provider\n   329→  redirectUrl: \"myapp://auth-callback\",                // Required: where to redirect after auth\n   330→  // Optional: specify keychain URL for custom deployments\n   331→  keychainUrl: \"https://x.cartridge.gg\",\n   332→});\n   333→```\n   334→\n   335→## Compatibility Guide\n   336→\n   337→The following

380→\n   381→#### StarkNet v8 Breaking Changes\n   382→\n   383→If you're using `WalletAccount` directly in your application, you'll need to update the constructor call:\n   384→\n   385→```ts\n   386→// Before (v0.9.x)\n   387→const account = new WalletAccount(provider, address, signer);\n   388→\n   389→// After (v0.10.0)\n   390→const account = new WalletAccount({\n   391→  nodeUrl:

favor of the EIP-6963 standard. If your application relied on MetaMask SDK-specific features:\n   400→\n   401→- Wallet detection now uses EIP-6963 standard wallet detection\n   402→- All Ethereum wallets are now handled through a shared base class\n   403→- This change improves bundle size and wallet compatibility\n   404→\n   405→#### Lodash Removal\n   406→\n   407→The lodash dependency has been completely removed. If you were importing lodash utilities from this package, you'll need to replace them with custom utilities or install lodash separately in your application.\n   408→\n   409→## Development Workflow\n   410→\n   411→If you're contributing to the Cartridge Controller or running the examples locally, you have two development modes available:\n   412→\n   413→### Local Development Mode\n   414→\n   415→```bash\n   416→pnpm dev\n   417→```\n   418→\n   419→This runs all services locally with local API endpoints, perfect for offline development and testing changes to the controller itself.\n   420→\n   421→### Production API Testing Mode\n   422→\n   423→```bash\n   424→pnpm dev:live\n   425→```\n   426→\n   427→This hybrid mode runs the keychain and examples locally while connecting to production APIs.\n   428→The `dev:live` mode provides production RPC endpoints, Auth0, Stripe, and Turnkey configurations while keeping the keychain frame at `localhost:3001` and your application at `localhost:3002`.\n   429→\n   430→:::warning\n   431→The `dev:live` mode connects to production APIs, so be careful with any transaction testing as it will use real network resources.\n   432→:::\n   433→\n   434→## Examples\n   435→\n   436→For more detailed examples of how to use Cartridge Controller in different\n   437→environments, check out our integration guides:\n   438→\n   439→1.
