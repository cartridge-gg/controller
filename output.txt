fix: SessionProvider preset support and address normalization (#2401)\n## Summary\n\nFixes #2399.\nAddresses `session/not-registered` errors caused by policy hash\ndivergence between the SDK and keychain.\n\n### SDK changes (`@cartridge/controller`)\n\n- **Add `preset` and `shouldOverridePresetPolicies` to\n`SessionOptions`**: Developers can now pass `preset: \"my-game\"` instead\nof manually duplicating policies.\nPreset policies are resolved via `loadConfig()` from\n`@cartridge/presets`, matching the keychain's behavior.\nPolicy precedence matches `ControllerProvider`: preset wins unless\n`shouldOverridePresetPolicies: true`.\n- **Consolidate async init into `_init()`**: Preset resolution, session\nretrieval from storage, and signer key setup all happen in a single\neagerly-started async method.\nPublic methods (`username`, `probe`, `connect`) simply `await\nthis._ready`.\n- **Normalize addresses in `toWasmPolicies`**: Applies\n`getChecksumAddress()` to contract targets before hashing, preventing\ndivergence from inconsistent address casing.\n- **Extract `getPresetSessionPolicies` utility**: Shared between\n`SessionProvider` and the keychain's `getConfigChainPolicies`, replacing\n~25 lines of defensive type narrowing with a clean helper.\n- **Warn on silent policy drop**: When both `preset` and `policies` are\nprovided without the override flag, a `console.warn` is logged\n(previously policies were silently ignored in `ControllerProvider`).\n- **Send `preset` in keychain URL**: When preset is used, `connect()`\nsends `&preset=` instead of `&policies=`, so the keychain resolves the\nsame policies from the same source.\n\n### Keychain changes\n\n- **Gate rendering on `isPoliciesResolved` in `Authentication`**: The\n`Authentication` wrapper now waits for preset policies to fully resolve\nbefore rendering child routes.\nThis replaces scattered `isPoliciesResolved` guards that were previously\nin `ConnectRoute` and eliminates race conditions where components render\nbefore async preset policy resolution completes.\n\n### Root cause\n\nWhen a developer configured presets and used `SessionProvider`, the\nkeychain would resolve policies from the preset while the SDK used the\ndeveloper's manually-passed policies.\nIf these differed (or if addresses had different casing), the session\nhash would diverge, producing `session/not-registered` errors.\n\n### Design note\n\nPreset resolution is async (`loadConfig` fetches from the network), but\nJS constructors can't be async.\nThe `_init()` method is eagerly started in the constructor and stores\nits promise as `_ready`.\nA cleaner alternative would be a static factory method\n(`SessionProvider.create(options)`), but that's a breaking API change —\nworth considering in a future major version.\n\n### Follow-up\n\n- Apply same preset support to `TelegramProvider` and Node.js\n`SessionProvider`\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] All 45 controller unit tests pass (including updated\n`toWasmPolicies` tests)\n- [x] All 356 keychain tests pass\n- [x] `tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors\n- [x] Full monorepo build succeeds\n- [x] Lint and format checks pass\n- [ ] Manual verification with a preset-configured app using\nSessionProvider\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nbd9fd92c -
